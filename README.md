# Intro

This repository contains automated test scripts for verifying the creation and management of blockchain nodes using Moralis, integrating both UI and API testing. The tests cover key features like node creation, transaction validation, and fetching wallet NFTs, utilizing Playwright and Synpress for seamless automation.

pnpm run build:cache

# Or in a headless mode:
pnpm run build:cache:headless
```

6. Run Playwright tests as you would normally do:
